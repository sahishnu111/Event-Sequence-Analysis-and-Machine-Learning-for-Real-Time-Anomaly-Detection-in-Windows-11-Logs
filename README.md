# Event-Sequence-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-for-Real-Time-Anomaly-Detection-in-Windows-11-Logs
This project introduces a hybrid system for real-time anomaly detection in Windows 11 logs. By converting logs into unique event sequences using machine learning and the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, it accurately identifies malicious threats, offering robust cybersecurity for modern operating systems.
